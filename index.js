// Write a function called superbowlWin() in index.js that:
//  * Receives 1 argument, an Array of JavaScript Objects 
// * Each object has two properties: year and result
//  * Use find() to test each Object to see if the result is "W" â€” a win!
//  *  * superbowlWin() should return the year when the win occurred (if it occurred at all!). 
// If no win is found, it should return, sadly, undefined

// roommates.find( function(s) { return s === "winston" })

function superbowlWin(obj){
    const wonGame = obj.find(({result}) => result === "W")
     console.log(wonGame)
    // return wonGame
